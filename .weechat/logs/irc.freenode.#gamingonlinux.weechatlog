2015-10-04 20:17:38	drumr7	yeah more games
2015-10-04 20:17:45	drumr7	as if we dont have enough of them to play
2015-10-04 20:18:18	@Samsai	games are bad, we shouldn't get more
2015-10-04 20:24:07	lemon_snowCone	that is a lot of platforms they are going support Future_Suture
2015-10-04 20:24:10	lemon_snowCone	for just 250K
2015-10-04 20:24:50	Future_Suture	lemon_snowCone, yea, but they are a proven developer, and I guess they're getting funding from publishers as well. Kickstarter helps them argue better terms, I'm sure.
2015-10-04 20:25:13	lemon_snowCone	probably
2015-10-04 20:25:21	lemon_snowCone	looks like they got funding from else where too
2015-10-04 20:28:11	drumr7	they probably start in linux and port elsewhere maybe that is why cost is low
2015-10-04 20:28:16	drumr7	anyway someone is probably matching it

2015-10-04 20:28:50	drumr7	i know one company needed some funds to make the 5 minute demo to show the publisher who was going to fund it
2015-10-04 20:29:01	drumr7	they already had a committment from them
2015-10-04 20:29:18	drumr7	obviously they had to like the demo but some of the graphics and stuff was already done but just not in the engine
2015-10-04 20:30:20	Future_Suture	Funds for a 5 minute demo? o.o
2015-10-04 20:30:38	drumr7	yeah
2015-10-04 20:30:43	drumr7	it was all privately funded
2015-10-04 20:31:07	Future_Suture	Just how difficult and how long does it take to make a 5 minute demo? >_<

2015-10-04 20:31:30	drumr7	well its more involved

2015-10-04 20:32:36	Future_Suture	Graphics and stuff were done, but not in the engine. How hard is it to put them in the engine, lemonY_snowCone?
2015-10-04 20:32:44	@Samsai	Future_Suture, remember that the cost of a game isn't directly proportional to the length of the game
2015-10-04 20:33:19	@Samsai	you need plenty of initial funding to lay down the groundwork, after that you are basically just building on top of that
2015-10-04 20:34:38	@Samsai	so a 5 minute demo might very well end up costing so much money that you need some extra funding, depends on the kind of demo naturally
2015-10-04 20:35:59	drumr7	thats right the game is well on the way to finish it
2015-10-04 20:36:14	drumr7	once you have the base laid
2015-10-04 20:37:48	drumr7	id do the quest designer

2015-10-04 20:39:39	drumr7	there can be more funding behind the scenes

2015-10-04 23:15:47	gnarface	where does steam in-home streaming use as an audio source by default? line-in?

2015-10-04 23:18:18	Piratelv	I would imagine that in-home streaming uses the monitors pulseaudio creates for each output to grab the game audio
2015-10-04 23:19:58	gnarface	Piratelv: oh, so it requires pulseaudio for audio?  that would explain it
2015-10-04 23:20:41	gnarface	i don't have pulseaudio installed, so my host isn't sending audio
2015-10-04 23:24:39	Piratelv	well, I don't "know" if it needs pulseaudio, never actually checked. but bother steamos and ubuntu use that as default sound system so it's a fair guess

2015-10-04 23:39:54	stqn	gnarface: yes, it is true, and I think it’s not the first time we have that conversation
2015-10-04 23:40:29	gnarface	well it MIGHT be impossible to record the PCM output using only software without a patch cable, i think we did have that conversation
2015-10-04 23:40:35	stqn	right
2015-10-04 23:40:52	Ysblokje	1) PA should die, a horrible deatch at that. 2) ALSA should have more user friendly tools (which PA does have)
2015-10-04 23:41:04	GermainZ	Why should PA die?
2015-10-04 23:41:06	gnarface	but there were results to my google search suggesting this used to work and got broke in some update

2015-10-04 23:43:17	Ysblokje	6 - 12 months ago. Then I just removed it.
2015-10-04 23:43:37	Ysblokje	Now on Arch it didn't come with the first DE I installed :)

2015-10-04 23:48:17	Ysblokje	It belongs in a microkernel OS ;)

2015-10-04 23:50:41	Ysblokje	That would have been fine too, but I think a license problem with the original OSS spawned the ALSA development.

2015-10-05 01:39:49	Raven67854	tadzik, its for the convergence thing man.. Not sure its included in the desktop version though
2015-10-05 01:39:49	Half-Shot	I like how gnome have their own browser
2015-10-05 01:40:18	tadzik	Raven67854: ah, fair enough
2015-10-05 01:40:29	Raven67854	why its*
2015-10-05 01:40:36	Raven67854	Firefox is and will remain the default though
2015-10-05 01:40:38	tadzik	seems like absolutely everybody didn't learn their lesson about "don't make your own browser"
2015-10-05 01:40:50	Raven67854	tadzik, It's basically just webkit in a qt window :p
2015-10-05 01:41:02	tadzik	yeah, and that's why nobody will like it :)
2015-10-05 01:41:03	Raven67854	Supports WebGL really well
2015-10-05 01:41:17	Raven67854	tadzik, It uses barely any ram actually
2015-10-05 01:41:26	Raven67854	Because unlike chrome/firefox it has no extensions
2015-10-05 01:41:32	Raven67854	It's even lighter than midori
2015-10-05 01:42:05	tadzik	opera manages to be a ram hog on mobile even without extensions :P
2015-10-05 01:42:13	tadzik	but it has its own crazy stuff
2015-10-05 01:42:33	tadzik	what I see is, whenever a company rolls out their own browser, user keep coming out with feature requests
2015-10-05 01:42:45	tadzik	and after a while they want so much that you may as well just take a readymade browser anyway

2015-10-05 01:53:02	tadzik	is the lack of communication as gamebreaking in dota as it is in cs?

2015-10-05 02:23:15	tadzik	occasionally, yes :)
2015-10-05 02:26:46	pdq	is fun game though, addicting trying to better self at it, dota 2 i tried a few dozen games, seems hard but also very competitive and skill based
2015-10-05 02:26:46	pdq	i never played lol or anything
2015-10-05 02:27:48	tadzik	from what I heard lol is like a tricycle dota
2015-10-05 02:27:55	pdq	i was so hoping the new tony hawk game was going to come to pc (windows) then hope also come to linux but looks cosole only, tony hawk pro skater games were like my fav games of all time, those are alo failry competitve and skill to learn
2015-10-05 02:28:03	tadzik	the new game is garbage
2015-10-05 02:28:14	tadzik	all the things that were good about thps are gone
2015-10-05 02:28:30	tadzik	your best bet is dusting off thug2 or something probably :)
2015-10-05 02:28:34	pdq	are they?
2015-10-05 02:28:41	pdq	not coming to linux anyways
2015-10-05 02:28:42	tadzik	yeah
2015-10-05 02:29:25	tadzik	someone did a nice writeup on it on reddit
2015-10-05 02:29:30	tadzik	can't find it now
2015-10-05 02:29:46	tadzik	but the reviews trashed it, and from what I saw, rightfully so
2015-10-05 02:29:52	pdq	ah
2015-10-05 02:30:06	pdq	i seen on ign them doing gameplay etc but the player sucked bigtime
2015-10-05 02:31:46	tadzik	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY5_mpEHCUY looks like from someone who's familiar with the series

2015-10-05 02:32:00	pdq	worst lol sheesh
2015-10-05 02:32:17	pdq	is like the best IP imo, they fucked it up then
2015-10-05 02:32:42	pdq	only jet set radio would be better
2015-10-05 02:38:03	pdq	game still looks good if it was on pc and fixed all these menu and loading issues etc
2015-10-05 02:38:10	pdq	looks like same engine
2015-10-05 02:38:26	pdq	but they wont fix it or come to pc :P

2015-10-05 03:48:07	magamo	The version number of an ubuntu release is the year (-2000) followed by the month in which its released. So Ubuntu 15.10 will only come out in October of 2015, but there's generally an X.04 and X.10 release every year.
2015-10-05 03:48:40	magamo	Which means that they release every six months, April and October.
