2015-09-25 11:34:08	◥	GustavoAraujo (100007209372966@facebook) is back on server
2015-09-25 11:43:20	dean	did you see
2015-09-25 11:46:03	GustavoAraujo	Let me check
2015-09-25 11:54:01	GustavoAraujo	Well
2015-09-25 11:54:52	GustavoAraujo	I dont think you are wrong, but i think a week is a short time to really experiment a distro - I mean deeply -.
2015-09-25 11:55:18	dean	well a week long enough when i need a distro where i need to do lots of production work
2015-09-25 11:55:23	dean	the amount of times i recompiled llvm
2015-09-25 11:55:24	dean	urgghhh
2015-09-25 11:55:28	dean	30 minutes later
2015-09-25 11:55:48	dean	also i found the package maintainers on gentoo to be a bit lax
2015-09-25 11:56:07	dean	they really need to test their package dependencies a bit more before putting them in production
2015-09-25 11:56:13	dean	*looks at nvidia-settings*
2015-09-25 11:56:59	GustavoAraujo	I have had issues with nvidia in every fucking distro
2015-09-25 11:57:01	GustavoAraujo	Hahah
2015-09-25 11:57:24	GustavoAraujo	But yes, arch looks like ubuntu after gentoo
2015-09-25 11:57:33	dean	though it gives me a new appreciation for the arch devs
2015-09-25 11:57:39	dean	they do an amazing job
2015-09-25 11:57:53	dean	gentoo is just a bit rough round the edges for my liking
2015-09-25 11:58:18	dean	they really need to make the blocked packages messages more user intuitive
2015-09-25 11:59:49	GustavoAraujo	Hmmmm maybe
2015-09-25 12:00:13	GustavoAraujo	I will have a better understanding about gentoo in a year
2015-09-25 12:00:43	GustavoAraujo	I'm still too noob in gentoo
2015-09-25 12:00:52	GustavoAraujo	But arch is great
2015-09-25 12:01:05	GustavoAraujo	That's why I have arch on my system as well
2015-09-25 12:01:14	dean	haha i picked it up quickly, just what they consider stable packages is ancient. and when you start mixing and matching it gets messy
2015-09-25 12:01:41	GustavoAraujo	The downside of arch is those aur packages which people just forget to update properly
2015-09-25 12:01:51	dean	i do like gentoo though, i just needed something that is the same amount of os freedom just NOT THAT MUCH ;)
2015-09-25 12:02:00	dean	thats when you flag them in AUR
2015-09-25 12:02:13	dean	and if you not, you can ask to adopt the package if the maintaineer is nowhere to be seen
2015-09-25 12:02:19	dean	its the same with overlays in gentoo though
2015-09-25 12:02:37	GustavoAraujo	Yup, the same with ccr in chakra
2015-09-25 12:03:33	GustavoAraujo	But some times it does not work to flag them and if you dont have much time to adopt the package it's better to kee you quite
2015-09-25 12:03:40	dean	i've become good friends with the lead dev of blender
2015-09-25 12:03:42	GustavoAraujo	Keep*
2015-09-25 12:03:43	dean	hes from melbourne
2015-09-25 12:04:00	GustavoAraujo	Ohh that's interesnting
2015-09-25 12:04:14	dean	he used to used to use gentoo, but got tired of dependency issues. so he has been on arch for the past year or so
2015-09-25 12:04:26	dean	and when your a lead c++ dev for blender, you have all my respects
2015-09-25 12:04:30	dean	he is a full-time paid dev as well
2015-09-25 12:04:55	GustavoAraujo	Also i think sometimes we dont need bleeding edge stuff... We do that like a drug but its unecessary
2015-09-25 12:05:16	GustavoAraujo	I agree about this blender guy
2015-09-25 12:05:34	GustavoAraujo	My stable distro of choice is pclinuxos
2015-09-25 12:05:42	GustavoAraujo	It just makes sense 
2015-09-25 12:05:48	GustavoAraujo	You have to try it
2015-09-25 12:05:54	dean	i've been tempted to put bsd in a vm and see how painful it really is
2015-09-25 12:06:00	dean	you know you can go one up from gentoo right
2015-09-25 12:06:01	dean	slackware
2015-09-25 12:06:03	dean	haha
2015-09-25 12:06:11	GustavoAraujo	But try it not not dean, try it like a normal person haha
2015-09-25 12:06:15	dean	no dependecy manager at all, its all up to you to figure it out
2015-09-25 12:07:12	GustavoAraujo	Slackware is a mess... Seriously... How can you maintain a distro without dep checking?
2015-09-25 12:07:14	GustavoAraujo	Haha
2015-09-25 12:07:24	GustavoAraujo	Sounds like a nightmare
2015-09-25 12:08:09	GustavoAraujo	Maybe it's good for people who just use emacs and all its programs 
2015-09-25 12:08:11	GustavoAraujo	Haha
2015-09-25 12:09:19	dean	for me. i'll stick to arch. because mainly really, i like the bleeedin' edge
2015-09-25 12:09:27	dean	and people who say arch breaks all the time are full of shit
2015-09-25 12:09:39	dean	i had tiny small break in my 2 1/2 year old install
2015-09-25 12:09:52	dean	and that was just the cups systemd service
2015-09-25 12:11:48	GustavoAraujo	Yup
2015-09-25 12:12:03	GustavoAraujo	Actually thats not a better distro
2015-09-25 12:12:22	GustavoAraujo	The best is the one that fits your needs
2015-09-25 12:12:32	dean	unless you use ubuntu
2015-09-25 12:12:36	dean	and then you are just a lowly pleb
2015-09-25 12:12:40	GustavoAraujo	Hahahahhaha
2015-09-25 12:12:42	dean	to be fair i use ubuntu server all the time
2015-09-25 12:12:53	GustavoAraujo	I use xubuntu
2015-09-25 12:12:54	dean	cause its actually really good as a headless server
2015-09-25 12:13:04	GustavoAraujo	Which does not use systemd
2015-09-25 12:13:18	dean	well ubuntu actually now has three init systems in place.. haha
2015-09-25 12:13:23	dean	upstart, openrc and systemd
2015-09-25 12:13:30	dean	and you can use whichever one you want. haha
2015-09-25 12:13:53	dean	one thing i tempted to do with my arch reinstall actually is to remove systemd and put openrc on it
2015-09-25 12:13:56	GustavoAraujo	Ubuntu is fine, but you have to do fresh installs after 6 months haha
2015-09-25 12:14:59	dean	headless server you are usually fine tbh
2015-09-25 12:15:18	dean	i never use ubuntu as a desktop os ever
2015-09-25 12:15:23	dean	just the headless server application
2015-09-25 12:16:58	GustavoAraujo	Dude, lets change the subject
2015-09-25 12:17:08	GustavoAraujo	Give me a visa to go to au
2015-09-25 12:17:10	GustavoAraujo	Hahahaha
2015-09-25 12:17:30	GustavoAraujo	Brazil is having a heavy crisis
2015-09-25 12:18:35	dean	you mention this everytime i speak to you
2015-09-25 12:18:54	dean	i think the world is in a general crisis now
2015-09-25 12:19:01	dean	a capitalist crisis
2015-09-25 12:20:12	GustavoAraujo	Maybe
2015-09-25 12:21:16	dean	you know what i'm sick of
2015-09-25 12:21:23	dean	people being too fucking ultra politically correct
2015-09-25 12:21:31	dean	to the point no one can have a sense of humour anymore
2015-09-25 12:21:35	dean	thank god for south park
2015-09-25 12:22:33	GustavoAraujo	If you hate that... You would be crazy living here
2015-09-25 12:23:06	dean	oh its global
2015-09-25 12:23:25	GustavoAraujo	We call that "politicamente correto"
2015-09-25 12:23:30	GustavoAraujo	Almost the same word
2015-09-25 12:24:11	GustavoAraujo	I have watched Psicose with my girl yesterday
2015-09-25 12:24:17	GustavoAraujo	Awesome film
2015-09-25 12:24:34	dean	haha i shall look it up

2015-09-25 12:51:20	GustavoAraujo	I love this controller
2015-09-25 12:51:37	dean	haha last emulation i did was testing star ocean 3 at 2k
2015-09-25 12:51:47	GustavoAraujo	It's light as a paper and its d-pad is the best
2015-09-25 12:51:50	dean	seems that pcsx2 has done major overhauls on their gfx plugin
2015-09-25 12:52:02	dean	remember how depth of field kind of looked all fucked, with the double vision kind of effect
2015-09-25 12:52:24	dean	as it was a ps2 trick to try and give that effect on old crt tv's
2015-09-25 12:52:38	GustavoAraujo	I should try star ocen 3 ... I will have to finiah it
2015-09-25 12:52:45	GustavoAraujo	Finish*
2015-09-25 12:52:48	dean	haha, i bought it when i came out
2015-09-25 12:52:50	dean	got to the final boss
2015-09-25 12:52:52	dean	never finished it
2015-09-25 12:53:03	GustavoAraujo	Hahahahahhaa
2015-09-25 12:53:09	dean	happened with star ocean 2 as well
2015-09-25 12:53:14	dean	the only game i really did that with
2015-09-25 12:53:19	GustavoAraujo	The same for me in crono trigger
2015-09-25 12:53:38	dean	chrono cross didn't do it for me.
2015-09-25 12:53:51	dean	though as always yasunori mitsuda out does himself on both of those ost's
2015-09-25 12:53:57	dean	he also did xenogears and xenosaga
2015-09-25 12:54:44	GustavoAraujo	I think i will never have time to play pc games cause I have a big list of console games to play
2015-09-25 12:55:01	dean	haha i played a lot when i had the consoles
2015-09-25 12:55:06	GustavoAraujo	There is an awesome rpg on the mega drive which I juasr forgot now ....
2015-09-25 12:55:18	dean	that new one that is on the steam store as well
2015-09-25 12:55:29	GustavoAraujo	Nope
2015-09-25 12:55:40	GustavoAraujo	It's a classic one let me check
2015-09-25 12:55:41	dean	all i can think of when it comes to mega drive is phantasy star
2015-09-25 12:56:12	dean	the snes owned that area of the market back in the day
2015-09-25 12:56:38	dean	actually lets be fair, the snes owned the mega drive overall hardware wise
2015-09-25 12:56:53	dean	and i don't even like nintendo
2015-09-25 12:57:02	dean	but where credit is due, the snes was great

2015-09-25 13:00:57	GustavoAraujo	The games in both consoles were equaly great titles
2015-09-25 13:01:43	GustavoAraujo	And actually I can name more great mega drives games than snses ones
2015-09-25 13:06:28	dean	i could probably name more snes than megadrive
2015-09-25 13:06:36	dean	unfortunately the megadrive got tained by sega cd and the 32x
