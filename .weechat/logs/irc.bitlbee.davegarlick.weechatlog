2015-09-25 14:13:20	DaveGarlick	Finally getting around to watching the rest of the Mr Robot series. Damn cool.
2015-09-25 14:13:31	dean	haha aint it
2015-09-25 14:13:43	dean	the first tv show to show computers in a realistic light
2015-09-25 14:14:19	dean	did you receive those hard drives btw, if not i'll go to au post tomorrow
2015-09-25 14:15:24	dean	i was watching the cmd line stuff on that show to make sure it was accurate and it was
2015-09-25 14:15:26	dean	that is damn rare
2015-09-25 14:16:09	DaveGarlick	It also has specific culture references as background and in the periphery which is refreshing as opposed to THIS IS A THING WE WE ARE GOING TO USE IN OUR PLOT......BASK IN THE GLORY OF OUR THING THAT WILL BE USED IN THE PLOT. :)
2015-09-25 14:16:40	dean	it was actually developed and produced by the same production crew who did the first season of true detective
2015-09-25 14:16:46	dean	"anonymous content" amusingly enough
2015-09-25 14:16:58	dean	and you can see the similarities
2015-09-25 14:17:15	DaveGarlick	It's definitely a hoot. Great soundscape as well.
2015-09-25 14:17:28	dean	glad you are enjoying it
2015-09-25 14:17:47	dean	since the show got popular i get mistaken for elliot all the time on public transport. haha
2015-09-25 14:19:12	dean	doesn't help i sit on the train in a linux terminal either
2015-09-25 14:19:20	DaveGarlick	Yeah, I've been following some of threads. It's very Sneakers. :)
2015-09-25 14:19:37	dean	haha, the show takes the piss out that movie btw
2015-09-25 14:19:44	dean	i think its episode 3-4
2015-09-25 14:20:09	dean	it blatently goes "fucking hollywood and how think hacking really works."
2015-09-25 14:21:33	DaveGarlick	It was ripe for it, even at the time. I remember watching it in the theatre and us nerders' seething at some of the bollocks but it does have a Cray one.
2015-09-25 14:22:08	dean	i remember watching it going "pfftt.. as if bbs's look like that"
2015-09-25 14:26:43	DaveGarlick	I think I already mentioned running an 8 line BBS from an abandoned half burnt out inside the uni grounds squat using ex-hours retired throbbing racal vadic modems blistering along at 2400bps running on an Amstrad CPC464, Ami' 500 and Atari ST 14040. Great days.
2015-09-25 14:28:08	dean	you did
2015-09-25 14:28:11	dean	and that is insane
2015-09-25 14:28:32	dean	all i ever did was run ezyboard, then remoteaccess, then pcboard, then oblivion/2 on a 286
2015-09-25 14:28:43	dean	i really do fucking miss bbs's though
2015-09-25 14:30:02	DaveGarlick	Fuck yeah, it was such a great community. You'd write something cool and just out the excitement of finding a way to do a specific task share it to everyone so the whole thing operated in a more effiecient manner.
2015-09-25 14:31:43	dean	lets be honest, i miss the days when computers your a niche interest
2015-09-25 14:34:25	DaveGarlick	Tue enough. I should get you to stomp my 2012r2 server at some stage and help me out with any security holes if you don't mind.
2015-09-25 14:34:59	dean	sure
2015-09-25 14:35:11	dean	why are you using 2012r2 as your platform may i ask?
2015-09-25 14:35:50	DaveGarlick	Had a spare license with cals, so it runs as the media server of all things. :)
2015-09-25 14:36:37	dean	ah i see.. so what are running on it currently? what media daemons are you using?
2015-09-25 14:37:14	DaveGarlick	none and standard install.
2015-09-25 14:37:30	dean	oh but it is what you want to do
2015-09-25 14:37:40	dean	i just finished creating a media server for a friend remotely
2015-09-25 14:37:55	dean	had to setup monitoring daemons cause he has no fucking clue how it works on the backend
2015-09-25 14:38:04	dean	so i watch it from time to time
2015-09-25 14:38:14	dean	linux scares people too much. haha
2015-09-25 14:43:03	DaveGarlick	That is does. Custom elevator system, conveyor belt systems with PLC's and recently a hitachi crane are the last experience I've had with linux oh and a music work station from Italy. Google is always my friend when it comes to linux.
2015-09-25 14:48:17	dean	haha.. yeah.. i'm yet to really try linux as a music production os yet though
2015-09-25 14:48:26	dean	though there are wrappers for vsts now, i know that much
2015-09-25 14:52:43	DaveGarlick	I was running  a Debian disti version of...something that worked really well with my old Hoontech audio capture cards a while  but it was a bit cludgy' after being used to Cubase. Donated the whole system to a good cause. I think it still runs in a Youth centre in Lismore somewhere. Absolutely bullet proof with a mind bendingly small foot print and resource requirements. :)
2015-09-25 14:54:44	dean	bitwig is something you should look at it
2015-09-25 14:54:49	dean	made by ex ableton devs
2015-09-25 14:57:37	DaveGarlick	I seriously went "fully sick" ( sorry ) Ableton for a while for pumping out ideas it was great but thewhole using someone elses loops started to distract me from actual playing. Jeebus, I even had a many flashing leds APC 40 for a month. :)
2015-09-25 14:59:46	dean	haha
2015-09-25 14:59:57	dean	yeah im into the sample thing so much (pre made loops)
2015-09-25 15:00:02	dean	though venetian snares is ridiculous
2015-09-25 15:00:12	dean	to the point he uses a tracker still
2015-09-25 15:04:08	DaveGarlick	I'm really not a player. I just like to noodle and twist 1960's potentiometers in real time. Some of the auto time signature and time shift technologies is pretty amazing. I just leave my shit unquantised and out of toooon.
2015-09-25 15:04:43	dean	which is unique coming from an electronic artist to say "unquantised". its refreshing to hear
2015-09-25 15:09:56	DaveGarlick	Of course then I have the issue of playing a really groovy heavily syncopated piece to people and they proclaim "It's good but the drums and bass line is out of time". To which usually reply I play sax man, deal with it. :)
2015-09-25 15:13:18	dean	hahahaha. good excuse
2015-09-25 15:13:33	dean	i deliberately de-quantifying all of my instruments when composing in cubase
2015-09-25 15:14:15	DaveGarlick	Wait there's a de-quantify function?

2015-09-25 15:35:38	dean	google it :)
2015-09-25 15:35:48	dean	i think its called "humanising" or something to an effect
2015-09-25 15:39:01	DaveGarlick	Cool. but disturbing, but cool, yet disturbing but......I'm running 5 so it could be an addition..
2015-09-25 15:40:21	dean	i think it is in version 5
