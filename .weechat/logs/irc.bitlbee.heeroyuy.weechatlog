2015-09-25 11:34:58	HeeroYuy	Valve has officially announced they prefer vulkan and are pushing developers to use it.
2015-09-25 11:36:27	HeeroYuy	true true,
2015-09-25 11:36:30	HeeroYuy	nintendo has just joined as well
2015-09-25 11:36:47	HeeroYuy	because they are going to be making mobile games
2015-09-25 11:37:03	dean	vulkan is huge a thing in the open source community
2015-09-25 11:37:28	dean	the vulkan api is being put into linux kernel 4.3 - the amdgpu gallium3d drivers inside the kernel will already support it
2015-09-25 11:37:30	dean	a first for amd
2015-09-25 11:37:35	HeeroYuy	I didn't know they had soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many backers from large industries.
2015-09-25 11:37:50	dean	haha, you don't read enough tech sites
2015-09-25 11:38:08	HeeroYuy	Truth truth
2015-09-25 11:38:13	HeeroYuy	I read newspapers >.<
2015-09-25 11:38:40	dean	why i kept saying vulkan over directx in past fb posts that you've put up
2015-09-25 11:39:00	dean	vulkan is multi-platform, makes development cheaper and easier and makes for consistancy overall
2015-09-25 11:39:01	HeeroYuy	true true true true true
2015-09-25 11:39:15	dean	where as dx is fucking windows centric, that it runs on nothing else
2015-09-25 11:39:16	dean	for eg.
2015-09-25 11:39:30	dean	ps3/ps4 had a 3d api that was forked from opengl with their own calls
2015-09-25 11:39:44	dean	actually the backend to both the ps3/ps4 is actually bsd
2015-09-25 11:39:53	dean	so its written on top of open source tech
2015-09-25 11:40:01	dean	not sure about the wii u
2015-09-25 11:40:04	dean	cause its a piece of shit
2015-09-25 11:40:26	dean	the reason for vulkan is because opengl has a ton of legacy code that makes it confusing for devs.
2015-09-25 11:40:37	dean	so they're essentially trimming it and making it easier to work with
2015-09-25 11:40:46	dean	once upon a time vulkan used to be called "NextGL"
2015-09-25 11:41:12	dean	..so says the dean wiki

2015-09-25 11:58:56	dean	funnily enough people think drugs cause these things, they don't - they just enable what is already there.

2015-09-25 12:15:18	HeeroYuy	You have expert problem solving skills for sure
2015-09-25 12:15:27	HeeroYuy	I'm more of a lazy/ghetto problem solver
2015-09-25 12:15:36	HeeroYuy	something wrong with your hardware? VELCRO!
2015-09-25 12:15:38	dean	haha, its just practice and motivatioin really
2015-09-25 12:15:54	dean	or just the way you look at a problem
2015-09-25 12:16:11	dean	to be fair, i'd say you are better than me at putting pc's together
2015-09-25 12:16:18	dean	i fucking hate doing that shit, but i do because its required of me
2015-09-25 12:16:41	dean	i remember when i had to put a 486SX33 together, now that wasn't easy
2015-09-25 12:16:45	dean	nothing is labelled
2015-09-25 12:17:00	dean	you can put things in the wrong and fry all the components in a flick of a switch
2015-09-25 12:17:01	HeeroYuy	I really like putting together systems
2015-09-25 12:17:08	dean	i like at pc building now like lego

2015-09-25 12:17:57	dean	too much hassle
2015-09-25 12:18:14	dean	when intel decide to actually create a decent upgrade (give it 10 years) then I'll change it
2015-09-25 12:18:43	HeeroYuy	watercooling is more to look cool then performance.
2015-09-25 12:19:05	HeeroYuy	Not going to look at the new Zen CPUs?
2015-09-25 12:20:54	dean	haven't looked into them, but if the price per performance ratio isn't good enough i wont buy em
2015-09-25 12:22:21	HeeroYuy	they are really pushing them but they won't be out til the end of next year
2015-09-25 12:22:40	dean	yeah then i'll wait another 6 months so they iron out any production bugs
2015-09-25 12:22:45	dean	don't trust intel as far as i can through them
2015-09-25 12:22:49	dean	haven't got the best track record
2015-09-25 12:23:00	HeeroYuy	Don't trust any hardware manufactures .
2015-09-25 12:23:13	HeeroYuy	maybe kingston and seagate,,,and seasonic....but only sometimes.
2015-09-25 12:23:30	dean	or you get great hardware and then they underdevelop the software for it
