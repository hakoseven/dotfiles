2015-09-25 12:19:09	dean	ehh. its fine
2015-09-25 12:19:29	dean	the server is a linux box.. so actually making mac's talk to linux is easier than windows talking to linux
2015-09-25 12:19:37	dean	especially when it comes to domain and user credentials
2015-09-25 12:20:13	dean	windows 10 is fucked for guest networking for example.. if you created an account with an email address.. you cannot do guest network map drives
2015-09-25 12:20:16	dean	fucking windows 10

2015-09-25 12:48:34	error406	I think that's cuz now they have gotten older, they see the world more from his perspective hehe

2015-09-25 13:28:22	dean	i'll give him some cred he is way better builder than us, but thats his job none the less
2015-09-25 13:28:41	dean	though building is not always the funnest part of pcs for me
2015-09-25 13:34:09	error406	lol yeah when its yer job it's good to be good at it! I'm always just "A fuck, cram it in does it turn on? ok done"

2015-09-25 13:36:23	dean	i removed gentoo btw, and put my old linux distro on.. too much fiddling for a production os. but i learnt a lot
